       the value should be JavaScript that will run when the event occurs

       and it's not reusable...

    <!-- Let's use a form to practice more events
     we'll leave action blank, so it will go nowhere
     but the default behavior of the submit button inside the form will still be to reload the page
     we may want to prevent this so we can validate data with JS -->
